Hi,  
I'm a WordPress starter theme based on [underscores (_s)](http://underscores.me/) with the CSS structured in Sass. I'm completely hackable and I'm not finished.  **Don't make me a parent theme!!** Use me to create something fun.  
#####How do you get started?
1. Download me from [Github](https://github.com/MissyBunnie/Sassy-Starter) or [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/sassy-starter)
2. Find and replace all sassy-starter tags and sassy_starter functions with your own tags and functions.
3. Make changes to make the theme all your own
