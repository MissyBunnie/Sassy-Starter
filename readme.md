Hi,  
I'm a starter theme based on [underscores(_s)](http://underscores.me/) with the CSS structured in Sass. I'm completely hackable and I'm not meant as an end game theme.  Don't make me a parent theme!! Use me to create something beautiful and fun.  
#####How do you get started?
1. Download me from github: [https://github.com/MissyBunnie/Sassy-Starter](“https://github.com/MissyBunnie/Sassy-Starter”)
2. Find and replace all sassy-starter and sassy_starter with the name of your theme.
3. Do something amazing!  

I hope you do amazing things and enjoy!

#####Coming Soon
+ Sass tutorial to assist in the usage of this theme
+ UX CSS Updates
